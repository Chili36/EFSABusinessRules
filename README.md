# EFSA-BR-Validator-C-
Validator for EFSA Datacollection Business rules


# WARNING: This is a work in progress. it does not even contain all current EFSA business rules. the project was born out of necessity to solve specifics problems with the Swedish SSD reporting, therefore is is highly unlikely this project will solve your specific problem, but perhaps it will serve as an starting point. 


This solution contains two projects, Efsas Business Rules Validator and ValidateXML. The rules are contained in the project EFSAS Business Rules Validator while the ValidateXML is a small consoleapplication used for verifying an XML-document. 


Known issues:
A lot of them, but feel free to edit and upload, 

usage:

running a Xelement through a rule generates an Outcome. In the Outcome there are properties stating if the rule passed or not and what values are used. this is a work in progress
